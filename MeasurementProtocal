Parameter
Required?

Explanation	Example
v	Required	Protocol Version	v=1
tid	Required	Tracking ID	tid=UA-123456-1
cid	Required (or use UserID instead)	Client ID	cid=213725098.1449428391
t	Required	Hit Type - typically pageview, event or transaction.	t=event
dl	Required for “pageview” hit type	Document Location - if your hit is a pageview, this is where you set the URL for that page. Must be encoded as a URL (see example).	dl=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
ec	Required for “event” hit type	Event Category - if your hit is an event, this is where you set the category, just like you would with a regular Google Analytics event.	ec=MyEventCategory
ea	Required for “event” hit type	Event Action - if your hit is an event, this is where you set the action, just like you would with a regular Google Analytics event.	ea=MyEventAction
sc	Optional	Session Control - set to “start” if you’re worried about continuing a user’s previous session within your session timeout window (default of 30 minutes). Set to “end” if you’re worried about a user continuing the session you’ve started within your session timeout window (recommended).	sc=end
aip	Optional	Anonymize IP - set this to 1 if the IP (i.e. office) from which you’re sending requests is filtered out of your reporting view (recommended).	aip=1
sr	Optional	Screen Resolution - necessary if you’re filtering out screen resolution (not set) traffic to reduce Measurement Protocol spam.	sr=1024x768
dh	Optional	Document Host Name - necessary if you have a hostname filter to reduce Measurement Protocol spam. Not necessary if you’re using dr (below).	dh=example.com
dr	Optional	Document Referrer - useful if you want to manually set the full source of your hit (as opposed to just hostname). Without this, Measurement Protocol hits are “direct”, meaning that they’ll inherit the source of the user’s previous session (which is often what you want). Must be URL encoded (see example).	dr=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
cd<dimensionIndex>	Optional	Custom Dimension - this requires a little bit of interface setup, but it’s useful for debugging to have a hit-level custom dimension to flag up which hits are sent by Measurement Protocol.	cd1=MeasurementProtocol
ni	Optional	Non-Interaction flag - useful for ensuring that Measurement Protocol events do not inflate your session count, or affect engagement metrics. This is only applicable to "event" hits.	ni=1
